# OFExpense

`OF` stands for `Oh Family` which is a series software focus on family scope, including children
education and couple's finance.

`Expense` means family cost. I made this application to record family member's expense and calculate
the sharing and balance.

Now only two members are supported, i.e. wife and husband.

You can define your expense class and sharing percentage, record expenses according to classes
individually and
finally go to the statistic page syncing records and checking the settlement.

This application use a P2P architecture to work, no server needed. You only need to synchronize your
records with your collaborator.

Enjoy it!

Not well tested. Propose to run on Qualcomm Snapdragon platform. According to my testing, MediaTek
Dimensity platform can only work as client.
